# MULMyWorld

This project is part of the EPITECH's first PGE year graphical (MUL) module

## Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to create a map editor using the CSFML Library

The user should be capable of editing a tilemap, modifiying each tile's altitude, color or any other attribute that would make the program a sufficiently good map editor.
This project, if done well can greatly help for the next project, the RPG.
